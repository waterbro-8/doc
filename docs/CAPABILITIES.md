# doc capability inventory

This inventory describes the current implementation. `available` means the repository contains the
end-to-end product path. `experimental` means the surface exists but still has an unstable contract
or incomplete regression coverage.

`doc capabilities --json` exposes a versioned, compact grouping of this expanded inventory for
automation.

## Document lifecycle

| Capability         | Status       | Current implementation                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Document tree      | available    | Create, rename, duplicate, move, sort, favorite, search, trash, restore, and permanent cleanup                          |
| Rich-text editing  | available    | Tiptap headings, lists, tasks, tables, columns, images, links, code, Mermaid, slash commands, outline, and find/replace |
| Templates          | available    | Todo, résumé, and project-highlight starters                                                                            |
| Version history    | available    | JSON and Yjs snapshots, block-aware diff, current-state protection, restore, and API/CLI read-only list/get              |
| Sharing            | experimental | READ/WRITE relations enforce owner/recipient boundaries, optional expiry, and revoke matching active WebSocket connections |
| Comments           | experimental | Attributed review comments that never rewrite document content; WRITE creates, READ lists                              |
| Publishing         | experimental | Public links, republish/unpublish, moderation, owner checks, public reading, and allowlist HTML sanitization exist      |
| Export and uploads | available    | Browser-side PDF export plus compressed image upload through the current OSS adapter                                    |

## Collaboration

| Capability       | Status       | Current implementation                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Realtime editing | available    | Yjs/Hocuspocus rooms, presence, collaboration cursors, reconnection state, and browser IndexedDB cache              |
| Authorization    | experimental | Entry and established-message checks use persisted owner/READ/WRITE access; revocation also closes matching sockets |
| Persistence      | available    | Yjs binary state and JSON projection stored against the same document                                               |
| Recovery path    | experimental | Restore first protects the current snapshot; concurrent replicas and active-room restore have multi-client tests    |

Primary implementation paths:

- `src/components/editor/hooks/useCreateEditor.ts`
- `services/collaboration/src/hocuspocus/`
- `services/collaboration/src/http/collab-routes.ts`

An established client is authorized again before each collaboration message. Revocation first
marks the matching connection read-only and advances its authorization epoch before closing it; a
database lookup that began earlier cannot reuse a stale WRITE result after that epoch changes. A
persisted revocation, document soft-delete, or ownership change therefore fails closed even if the
advisory socket-close request is unavailable. The close request uses an internal key and targets
one exact document-user pair; access events contain identifiers, outcomes, and counts but no
document content.

Version restore is explicitly staged rather than described as atomic. The Web layer commits a
recoverable current-state snapshot, then the collaboration service persists the target body before
mutating or broadcasting the active Yjs room. A persistence failure leaves all connected replicas
unchanged. If body restore succeeds but the final title projection fails, the API returns a
structured partial result with a stable operation ID, a recovery snapshot ID, and `retryable: true`;
reapplying the same immutable target and title is state-idempotent.

While access is absent, a reconnect is rejected and locally retained offline updates do not enter
the active room. A client that is granted access later must create a fresh authenticated connection;
its browser-side IndexedDB state can then participate in normal Yjs reconciliation. The repository
tests server-side reconnect denial and convergence, but does not yet automate browser IndexedDB
lifecycle behavior.

## Deliberate gaps

The following capabilities are not claimed:

- Collaboration-aware replacement of existing document content through API v1
- API/CLI delete, restore, version restore, publish, import, or export
- Complete like/unlike persistence, user-level deduplication, and abuse controls
- Provider-neutral object storage
- Reviewed production Prisma migrations
- Closure of the current framework, authentication, mail, and CSS toolchain security audit findings
- Browser-level IndexedDB disconnect/reconnect and access-regrant recovery coverage
- Complete audit events, rate limits, metrics, tracing, and structured logs

The first remote CLI surface intentionally uses API v1 rather than direct Prisma writes. Content
replacement remains deferred until it can pass through an active-room-aware Yjs mutation gateway
without bypassing version and restore semantics.
